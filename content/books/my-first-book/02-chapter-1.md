# Chapter 1: The Beginning

Every great journey begins with a single step. In this chapter, we'll explore the foundations of programming and why it matters in today's world.

## Why Learn Programming?

Programming is more than just writing code—it's about solving problems, creating solutions, and expressing creativity. Whether you're building websites, analyzing data, or creating games, programming gives you the tools to make your ideas a reality.

## The Basics

At its core, programming is about giving instructions to computers. These instructions are written in languages that both humans and machines can understand.

```javascript
// A simple example
function greet(name) {
  return "Hello, " + name + "!";
}

console.log(greet("World"));
```

## Learning Path

Everyone's journey is different. Some prefer to dive deep into theory first, while others learn by building projects. Find what works best for you and stick with it.

## Consistency is Key

The most important factor in learning programming is consistency. Even 30 minutes a day can lead to significant progress over time.
